# Sentiment Classification
Here I have worked on predicting the sentiment of movie review for which I took IMDB movie review data. For this, I used multiple models:
1) TFIDF + Classical model(Logistic + Random Forest)
2) LSTM Classification
3) LSTM with pretrained word embeddings(Eg. glove)
4) Fastext model
